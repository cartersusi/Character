I'm making a 2D platform Pixel Art game called "Goblin Slayer".
It's a dark fantasy dungeon crawler where you explore underground dungeons, fight off goblins, and gain loot.

Generate an image of a stone block that can be used as the floor the character runs on. Make sure that it blends so that the blocks can be repeatedly used in order to form a full platform.

Base Shape: square
Texture: Rough and uneven to emphasize the stone's natural feel.
Color Palette: Dark greys with subtle shading to match the dungeon's dark fantasy theme.
Detailing: Small cracks, scratches, or moss to convey age and use.
